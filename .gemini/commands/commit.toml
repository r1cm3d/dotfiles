1. **Analyze the staged changes** by running `git diff --cached` to understand what is being committed.
2. **Craft a commit message** following these rules:
   - Use **imperative mood** (e.g., "fix bug").
   - Keep the summary line under 70-75 characters.
   - **CRITICAL**: Describe the problem that motivated the change.
   - Describe user-visible impact and quantify optimizations if applicable.
   - Explain technical details of the change.
   - **ALWAYS** end the commit with a `Signed-off-by` line using the current git user (from `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`).
3. **Process**:
   - Run `git status`
   - Run `git add .` to stage ALL changes
   - Run `git diff --cached`
   - Get git user info
   - Create message and execute `git commit -m "<message>"`
